Lesson Goals
------------

This first lesson in our section on dealing with Online Sources is
designed to get you and your computer set up to start programming. We
will focus on installing the relevant software – all free and reputable
– and finally we will help you to get your toes wet with some simple
programming that provides immediate results.

We recomend instealling [Anaconda 3]. Anaconda is a package of software that includes Python 3, R, most of the Python packages used by digital historians. It also includes RStudio, Jupyter notebooks and the Spyder integrated development environment (IDE). Don't worry if you don't know much about any of these tools. The benifits of the Anaconda platform is all the software you need is installed through a simple process. The main drawback is it requires a Minimum 5 GB disk space to download and install. If diskspace is a concern, you can install [Miniconda] and then only add the Python packages you require. Alternatively, you can simply install [Python 3] and use the included Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE). This might be the best option on older machines or if you are working in a computer lab whith Python 3 installed and no ability to install new software.


In this opening module you will install the [Python programming
language][], the [Beautiful Soup HTML/XML parser][], and a text editor.
Screencaps provided here come from [Komodo Edit][], but you can use any
text editor capable of working with Python. Here's a list of other
options: [Python Editors][]. Once everything is installed, you will
write your first programs, "Hello World" in Python and HTML.

the Python Programming Language
-------------------------------

The programming language we will use in this series of lessons is Python, 
a free, open source language. Unless otherwise noted, we will be using 
**Python 3** throughout. Version 2 is no longer officially supported, 
but you might still find it used in older projects or lessons. 
[Python 3 has a few differences in formatting](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html) (think grammar rules), so beware if you find examples online that still use Python 2. They might not run under current versions of Python.

Backup Your Work!
-----------------

Before you download or install any new software, it is crucial that you
make backups of your work. You should back up your whole computer at least
weekly, and preferably more frequently. It is also a good idea to make
off-site backups of your work, so that you don't lose everything if
something happens to your computer or to your home or office. Sites like
[Dropbox][] provide easy-to-use and relatively
inexpensive online backup options.

### Choose Your Operating System

Step 1 – Install and Set Up Software
------------------------------------

In order to work through the techniques in this website, you will need to
download and install some freely available software. We have provided
instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux. Once you have installed the
software for your operating system, move on to '[Viewing HTML Files][]'.
If you run into trouble with our instructions or find something that
doesn't work on your platform, please let us know.
